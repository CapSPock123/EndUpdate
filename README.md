### Step 1: Installing Forge

Download the *latest* version of Forge for 1.20.1 here: https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.20.1.html

After that, open the .jar, and follow the instructions to install it onto Minecraft.

### Step 2: Installing End Update

Then, drag the file into your "mods" folder located in:

Windows: %APPDATA%\.minecraft

Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/minecraft

Linux: ~/.minecraft

If there is no "mods" folder, simply create one and drag the .jar file inside.

### Step 3: Running the Installation

### Notes

This is a Forge mod for Minecraft Java 1.20.1. This cannot be installed on Bedrock Edition.

Optionally, you can also instead use a launcher like Prism or ATLauncher to run this mod. Please search up a guide on how to install those if you wish to use those, or if you find the instructions provided here to install Forge too vague.
